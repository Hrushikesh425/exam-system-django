            <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially <strong>developed by Dennis Ritchie</strong> as
                a system
                programming
                language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory,
                simple
                set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like
                operating
                system or compiler development.

                C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating
                system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly
                <strong>as fast
                    as</strong>
                the code written in <strong>assembly language</strong>. Some examples of the use of C might be âˆ’
