                <strong class="fs-4">Class 11</strong> Physics will help understand the fundamentals of the subject in
                an efficient manner. Physics of
                class 11 deals with a total of <strong>15 chapters</strong>. The first chapter here is the
                <strong>physical world</strong> that deals with
                topics related to various physical forces. The next chapter here is <strong>Units and
                    Measurement</strong> that deals
                with
                unit, base units, system of units, derived units, etc. <strong>Motion in a straight line</strong>
                explores Kinematics
                further. Furthermore, <strong>Motion in a plane</strong> will teach you about the measurement of motion
                in a plane.
                Moreover,
                <strong>the Law of Motion</strong> chapter deals with the motion of a particle in space. <strong>Work,
                    Energy, and Power</strong> chapter
                explores the relation between these three quantities. <strong>Systems of Particles and Rotational
                    Motion</strong>
                explores
                the mathematical and theoretical part of these concepts. <strong>Gravitation</strong> chapter deals with
                the concept of
                gravitation in a detailed manner. <strong>Mechanical Properties of Solids</strong> chapter will teach
                you about the
                various
                physical properties of solids. Another chapter <strong>Mechanical Properties of Fluids</strong> will
                teach you about the
                various physical properties of gases and liquids. <strong>Thermal Properties of Matter</strong> is all
                about heat and its
                measurement. <strong>Thermodynamics</strong> is a macroscopic topic revolving around heat and
                temperature. <strong>Kinetic Theory</strong>
                explores the behaviour of gases. <strong>Oscillations</strong> chapter will take you in the depths of
                this concept.
                Finally,
                the <strong>Waves</strong> chapter deals with the conceptual study of waves.

                <strong class="fs-4">Class 12</strong> Physics explores deeply the various concepts of Physics of class
                12 deals with a total of <strong>15
                    chapters</strong>. <strong>Electric Charges and Field</strong> is the first chapter here that is
                concerned with electric charges,
                fields, and functional areas. <strong>Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance</strong> chapter lets you
                understand the
                different electric fields that have varying electrostatic potential. <strong>Current
                    Electricity</strong> is the next
                chapter
                where students will get an in-depth understanding of the electric current. Furthermore, <strong>Moving
                    Charges
